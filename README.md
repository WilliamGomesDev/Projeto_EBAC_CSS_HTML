    Outcome of the Full Stack Java course exercise proposal ðŸŽ¯
</h2>

  Create a website with a free theme, incorporating CSS, HTML, forms, images, titles, and custom fonts. My project is an example of an online cosmetics store with a login option. I hope you like it and feel free to add suggestions for improvement. I am happy with my first result for project number 1. Many more are yet to come, and I hope to improve every day.
